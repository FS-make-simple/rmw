# This is only an example configuration file, and should not be copied and
# used. A default configuration file - rmwrc - should have been included
# with the rmw package.
#
# NOTE: If 2 WASTE folders are on the same file system, rmw will ReMove files
# to the first WASTE folder listed, ignoring the 2nd one. Purge will still
# check the 2nd folder and remove files after a specified number of days.
#
WASTE = $HOME/.trash.rmw
WASTE = /mnt/fs3/.ctrash
#

# If you would like this to be your primary trash folder (i.e. tied to
# your Desktop Trash), be sure it's listed at the top, before other
# WASTE folders.
#
WASTE = ~/.local/share/Trash
#

# Removable media: If a folder has ',removable" appended to it, rmw
# will not try to create it; it must be initially created manually. If
# the folder exists when rmw is run, it will be used; if not, it will be
# skipped.
