rmw (ReMove to Waste) functions as a command line recycle bin/trash can 
utility. Optionally, it can ReMove files to Desktop trash and has been 
tested on GNOME, KDE, and Xfce. This is the binary version, not the 
bash script

rmw will read the system wide configuration file if $HOME/config/rmw
isn't present. (./configure --sysconfdir=...) If sysconfdir isn't specified
rmw defaults to /usr/local/etc

A generic configuration file looks like this:

WASTE = $HOME/.trash.rmw
#WASTE = $HOME/.local/share/Trash
purgeDays = 90

Purging can be disabled by using 'purgeDays = 0' in configuration file.

The C version of rmw can remove files in desktop trash automatically
after 'x' number of days.
