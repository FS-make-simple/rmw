=== rmw ChangeLog ===

-- Aug. 22, 2016 --

Fine-tuning the error-checking.
https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/13


-- Aug. 20, 2016 --

Added a bunch of error checking, mostly for things that rarely go wrong;
but now if they go wrong, the user (or me) will get to see an error number.

There is still a lot more error-checking that can be added.


-- Aug. 17, 2016 --

Documentation (README) updated and expanded, info added to --help option
(There is no 'man' page yet.

Fixed -B bug (https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/9)

-- Aug. 16, 2016

Added a lot more error-checking to rmdir_recursive() (basically I re-wrote
most of the function).

The most annoying problem I've had with rmw over the last few years is
if there are non-writeable files in a directory that is getting purged.
I'd always get the message "unknown error while removing..." Now it's more
specific.

RMDIR_MAX_DEPTH now used. rmdir_recursive() won't go deeper than the
number set in the header file (normally set to 32)

PROTECT= option implemented, but hasn't gone through very much testing yet.
It seems to have a problem if rmw is started with
'HOME=. rmw'. The problem is that the correct realpath isn't returned, so
a match is never made, and therefore protection is ignored.


-- Aug. 11, 2016

Issue #5 implemented
https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/5

Added some pointers, dispatched more globals


-- August 09, 2016

Trying to simplify things, I removed the --add-waste (a) option. I don't
think it adds much to ease-of-use and isn't worth maintaining the code.

-- August 08, 2016

rmw will now create the $HOME/.config dir if it doesn't exist (dev).

-- August 07, 2016

I've gotten rid of more global variables

the w_X paths are now in a structure


-- August 06, 2016 --

The potential mangling of the trash directory string when using "$HOME"
in the config file is now fixed!
https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/2

Release issued.

-- August 05, 2016 --

Release issued.


-- August 04, 2016 --

The trash directory string issues seems to be fixed. I'm not sure why. I
moved some global variables into main() - maybe that helped. ;)

I moved some functions into the main() part of the code.

-- August 02, 2016 --

Addressed issues with how the code had been split, updated Makefile to reflect changes


June 12, 2013

Purge will no longer run if -z or -s option is
