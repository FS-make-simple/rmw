The potential mangling of the trash directory string when using "$HOME"
in the config file is now fixed!

-Version 2016.08.05.01a-

I'm not seeing a problem anymore with the trash directory string
getting mangled.

This is a minor update to the last release from 2013. Besides the bug-fix,
I've been working at cleaning up the code, and plan to continue.
