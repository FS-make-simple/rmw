=== rmw ChangeLog ===

-- August 04, 2016 --

The trash directory string issues seems to be fixed. I'm not sure why. I
moved some global variables into main() - maybe that helped. ;)

I moved some functions into the main() part of the code.

Addressed issues with how the code had been split, updated Makefile to reflect changes
