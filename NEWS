    [#68] File sizes now display when using '--select' (patched by @suve)

2016-09-18

Two new developers have contributed patches to rmw: Parth Suresh and
Bruce Hernandez.

Notable changes from the previous release:

We believe the 'missing aclocal' error received when building is fixed.

When files are ReMoved or purged, each one will not not display unless
--verbose -v is used at the command line; instead, a summary line will
show how many files were ReMoved or purged.

For purge to run, -f --force is needed as an argument at the command line.
If 'force_not_required' is added to your config file, then using the extra
argument is not needed.

Restoring a file with the 'select' option will no longer fail.

Adding ',removable' after a WASTE folder in your config file will mean
that rmw won't try to create that directory; it must be manually created
prior to first use. If the WASTE folder is present, rmw will use it, if not
rmw will skip over it.

symlinks: rmw can now find the info file when restoring them.

Files can be restored using only the basename, from within any directory.
NOTE: That feature will not process wildcards unless the user is in a
<WASTE>/files folder and the filespec actually exists in the present
working directory.

.trashinfo files now conform to the freedesktop Trash specification
(e.g. if the Path= key in a .trashinfo contains '%20' as part of the filename,
it will be converted to a 'space' when it is restored).

2016-09-04

This release includes a fix for issue #24.

Notable changes since v2016.09.04.01a:

Improvements to directory protection feature (See README)

Added function to create directories when parents don't exist (sometimes
creating a WASTE directory would fail).

Added '-Wall' option to the Makefile, and then fixed the warnings
(issue #17)

Thanks to Jammy, I fixed the warning about missing automake 1.14 (issue #21)

Added more error checking for things that rarely go wrong.

Updated documentation; information for first-time users can be viewed
with 'rmw --help'.

I've optimized the code some but there is a lot more to do. If you
are interested in contributing and getting credit for your work, please
contact me via the methods listed in the README.

Anyone wishing to get notified of new releases may sign up for the
mailing list on SourceForge:

I still haven't decided what to use for a primary web site.

The potential mangling of the trash directory string when using "$HOME"
in the config file is now fixed!
https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/2

-- August 5, 2016 --
-Version 2016.08.05.01a-

I'm not seeing a problem anymore with the trash directory string
getting mangled.

This is a minor update to the last release from 2013. Besides the bug-fix,
I've been working at cleaning up the code, and plan to continue.
